Return Matrix[][] wherein each pair should be sorted.
Not aware of the size of the Matrix??

No of rows == N and No of cols == 2??
Not possible becuase in an array with all same elements, no of pairs
could be n^2
Initializing with such a big number would be a wastage of memory.

Solution is to use List<int[]>
